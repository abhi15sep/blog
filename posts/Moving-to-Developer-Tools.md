# Moving to the Developer Tools Team

I've been with Mozilla for over 3 years now, and it's been an amazing experience. I get to work with people smarter than me, have freedom to hack on all sorts of projects, and feel like I'm contributing to a greater good (I've worked on [http://mozilla.org/](mozilla.org) and a bunch of stuff related to web apps). That said, for a while I haven't been challenged and I've been looking for different team to utilize my skills.

As of this week, I'm moving to the [Firefox Developer Tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools) team, specifically the **scripting and performance team**. I couldn't be more excited! I think it's a perfect fit for me: complex JavaScript engineering challenges and a product that helps millions of developers.

I will help with the next version of our tools for measuring performance of the web, from JavaScript to layout jank and all sorts of other components. I will also help improve our debugger and basically anything that I find time to help with.

We have a lot of work to do, and I'm really excited to be a part of it. Firefox devtools are going to rock even more than they already do. Feedback is crucial, so let me know what you love/hate about our developers tools, and I'll make sure my team knows about it. Keep rockin' the free web!
